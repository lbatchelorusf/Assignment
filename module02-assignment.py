# Integrative Assignment: Module 2 – Type Conversion, Expressions, and Business Computations

# Step 1: Define variables
product_name = "Laptop Computer"  # Example product
units_sold_str = "25"  # Number of units as a string
price_per_unit_str = "899.99"  # Price as a string
tax_rate = 0.08  # 8% tax
discount_rate = 0.10  # 10% discount

# TODO: Convert string values to appropriate numeric types
units_sold = int(units_sold_str)
price_per_unit = float(price_per_unit_str)

# TODO: Calculate taxed_price (original price + tax)
# Hint: taxed_price = price_per_unit * (1 + tax_rate)
taxed_price = price_per_unit * (1 + tax_rate)

# TODO: Calculate net_price (taxed price - discount)
# Hint: net_price = taxed_price * (1 - discount_rate)
net_price = taxed_price * (1 - discount_rate)

# TODO: Calculate total_revenue
total_revenue = net_price * units_sold
 
# Print
print("Product:", product_name)
print("Net Price: $", round(net_price,2))
print("Total Revenue: $", round(total_revenue,2))
